Added:

1. components
2. loader for button and selection for input text
3. react-datepicker added
4. react-select added
5. react-data-grid added
6. changed loader

Need to consider:

1. write utils a method isEmpty --> <anArray.isEmpty()> and <anArray.delete()>
2. Redux should have selects and reselect lib
3. Redux state normalizing and Pure Components for optimization
4. Concurrent Mode
5. upload progress with saga or thunk, proper error handling is needed
6. npm run build bug
7. delete Poppins fonts
8. test on IOS/MAC/ANDROID/WINDOWS and browsers
